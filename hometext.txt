Welcome Starnger! 

You found a science-minded, descrete hungarian Man. 
I use my skills for create, design and help ideas to born. 

Currently I do full-stack development at Audi - Ingolstadt 
and 
study at University of Gy≈ër as BSc mechatronics engineer.  

My affinity towards math helped me a lot throught my career. 
I started my work life as a technical drower. 
Later I've got the luck to work with Centipede Labs and then I joined to Audi Hungaria's Trainee program and worked there as Scripter/Programmer.
Offten I functioned as "The Philomath, who will surely know the solution". An IT-Project started in Ingolstadt and I have a big part of it.    

What do I like to do when im not working?
When I'm not coding or study, i do like cooking, 3D Printing or I do my dear Projects.

It's no wonder, that im single, but my Friends fills this cup up. 

If you have any quiestions about me, 
or my projects please feel free to contact me.

Have a wonderful day!
